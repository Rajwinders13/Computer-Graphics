# Computer-Graphics
This repository contains various programs which are the implementation of line, circle and ellipse drawing algorithms. These codes were done during the lab of my Computer Graphics Course in 5th semester of my B.E in CSE program. 
The description of the files is given below-
1) BRESENHA.cpp is the source code where I have implemented the bresenham line drawing algorithm.
2) COHENSOU.cpp is the implementation of cohen southerland line clipping algorithm.
3) DDA.cpp is the implementation of digital differential analyzer algorithm of line drawing.
4) ELLIPSE.cpp is the source code to draw an ellipse.
5) IMAGE.cpp is the code which takes the input from the user in a matrix form and calculate 4 neighbours of the pixel and connectivity measurement.
6) LINEGRAP.cpp takes the input from the user and draws the line graph of the input data.
7) MIDPOINT.cpp is the implementation of midpoint algorithm to draw a circle.
8) NONBORDERPIXEL.cpp identifies the non-border pixels in an image, this is an integral part of majority of the thining algorithm.
9) ROTATE.cpp is the source code which performs the line rotations.
